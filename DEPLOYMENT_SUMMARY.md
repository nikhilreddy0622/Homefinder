# Homefinder - Deployment Preparation Summary

## Repository Initialization
- Initialized Git repository in the project root
- Added all project files to the repository
- Configured comprehensive `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files:
  - Environment configuration files (`.env`, `config.env`, etc.)
  - Node modules directories
  - Build artifacts and distribution files
  - Log files
  - IDE-specific files
  - Uploaded files and images

## Security Hardening
- Removed development logging from frontend and backend
- Secured sensitive API endpoints
- Implemented proper CORS configuration
- Removed hardcoded credentials from codebase
- Ensured JWT secrets are configurable via environment variables

## Production Configuration Files
Created production-ready configuration files:
- `.env.production` for frontend environment variables
- `config.production.env` for backend environment variables

## Code Optimization
- Removed unnecessary development-only code
- Optimized API service for production use
- Streamlined authentication context
- Improved header component performance
- Cleaned up backend server configuration

## Build Process
- Verified Vite build process works correctly
- Added production build scripts to package.json
- Created health check endpoints for monitoring

## Deployment Documentation
- Created comprehensive DEPLOYMENT.md guide
- Updated README.md with deployment instructions
- Added health check HTML page for monitoring

## Repository Status
The repository has been initialized with:
- All application source code
- Configuration files (excluding sensitive data)
- Documentation
- Build configurations
- Deployment guides

## Next Steps for GitHub Deployment
1. Create a new repository on GitHub at https://github.com/nikhilreddy0622/Homefinder
2. Add the remote origin:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/nikhilreddy0622/Homefinder.git
   ```
3. Push the code:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Environment Variables to Configure
After deployment, configure these environment variables in your hosting environment:

### Frontend
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL

### Backend
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `CLIENT_URL` - Frontend domain URL
- `JWT_SECRET` - Strong secret key for JWT tokens
- `SMTP_*` - Email configuration for production

## Important Notes
- Never commit sensitive files or credentials to the repository
- Always use environment variables for configuration
- Regularly update dependencies for security
- Monitor logs for errors in production
